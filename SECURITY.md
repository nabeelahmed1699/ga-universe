# Security Policy


## Report Vulnerability

We prioritize security in our project and welcome users to report any vulnerabilities they find. 
If you discover a security vulnerability in the GA_Universe project, please report it responsibly by emailing security@ga-universe.com.


While we don't currently have a bug bounty program, we are a small team working to address a significant challenge. 
We ask that you report vulnerabilities responsibly so we can continue to build a secure application for the entire community.
